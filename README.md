## Project: Routing Algorithms Visualization

## Introduction
This project contains examples of routing algorithms implemented on specific network architectures using [algorithm-visualizer.org](https://algorithm-visualizer.org/). The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the visualization of different routing algorithms and to help understand their behavior in different network configurations.

## Usage
You can simple copy the content of the javascript files and paste them on [algorithm-visualizer.org](https://algorithm-visualizer.org/) and then run it.

## Included Examples
- Hypercube routing
- CCC routing
- Butterfly routing

## Conclusion
This project provides a visual representation of various routing algorithms, making it easier to understand the behavior of these algorithms in different network configurations. By using [algorithm-visualizer.org](https://algorithm-visualizer.org/), it is possible to interact with the visualization and observe the effects of changes in the network on the behavior of the algorithms.
